### Motivation

I've been deeply interested in ML since the 9th grade in high school. Since then I have tried several fields, gravitating towards NLP and transformers. Prompt learning itself is an area I haven't touched much yet. Many people in the industry approach prompt engineering from more of an "art" standpoint, and this irritates me. The prompt can and should be treated as an input parameter for the model, which means it can be iteratively optimized. I feel like this is a great **learning opportunity** to me from ML standpoint.

The project also offers an opportunity to work on an API. I find software engineering **satisfying**, somewhat like mapping out a factory in Factorio. I feel like this project is the perfect place for me to train my skills in that regard, allowing to build something people are going to use.

Lastly, I've already done one internship at JetBrains this summer. The project I was offered was really atomic and didn't align much with what the team is busy with most of the time, so I didn't get to collaborate with them much. I feel like this project offers a much better opportunity to interact with a team of other professionals which I am also very curious about.

> Regardless of the outcome of this application, thank you for publishing this project. Task 2 was especially fun to work on; it legit puzzled me for several hours, and I'm still unsure if my solution is the best.
